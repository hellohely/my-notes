NPM PACKAGES USED:

Backend: express, mysql2, cors

Frontend: React,
tinymce,
react-router-dom,
react-hook-form, universal-cookie

To run locally, run backend on port "http://localhost:3000" and frontend on port "http://localhost:3001" to avoid CORS-errors when sending cookies to client.

SQL export is added for testing purposes (documents.sql)

In front end client, username is "username" and password is "password".
